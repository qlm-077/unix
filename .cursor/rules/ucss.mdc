### Layout Specifications
- Disable layout such as float, grid, etc., all containers must use display:flex, and the default direction is vertical (implemented via flex-direction:column)
- Page-level scrolling requires manual wrapping<scroll-view style="flex:1">, and it is recommended to use conditional compilation on Android

### Selector Restrictions
- Only class selectors (.class) are supported, ID/attribute selectors are prohibited (e.g.#id,[attr])
- Class names must comply with the [A-Za-z0 -9_-]+ specification, and special characters are prohibited (such as @class)

### Style isolation rules
- The text style (color, font-size) must be written <text>in the component, and the container component (<view>) prohibits setting text-related properties
- Disable inheritance-related keywords such as inherit and unset

### Hierarchy Control
z-index only takes effect on sibling nodes at the same level, and absolute fixed bits that are separated from the document stream do not support hierarchical coverage
